                    <h1>About Me!</h1>
                    <p>My name is John Walz. I am 18 years old and am currently going through Coding Dojo's awesome bootcamp in Seattle. I have written code for 3 months. I started coding when I was asked to work on a website for my dad's company<a class="eurotech" href="www.eurotechelite.com"> Eurotech Elite</a>. I found that I loved it so much that I started taking classes on codecademy and W3Schools. I did a lot of work on the company website(mainly building jquery widgets and plugins for marketing). I then built a salesforce website for Eurotech- a private, user-only website that contains all of the product info, pricing and quotes that our salesmen need.</p>
                    <p>I then decided that I wanted to do coding full time. I just love being able to imagine anything I want and create it in the virtual world. I love the feeling of total awesomeness when a complicated javascript algorithm runs perfectly.</p>
                    <p>So, I started researching ways to really dive into web development. I did not want to go to college for a four-year degree and many people said that to do so was a waste of time. I came across these coding bootcamps that really caught my attention. I decided that they were the best route for me to take, so I applied to Coding Dojo in Seattle and got accepted. I am here now just getting ready to start the grueling 12 weeks of onsite learning. I will be diving into three full stacks. I start with the hallowed LAMP stack and then move on to the MEAN stack. Then I finish up with Ruby on Rails. I am super excited!</p>
                    <p>I want to get a job back home in Florida when I finish the bootcamp and I came across your company in my job research. I think that I would be a perfect fit for your company. I am a hard-working individual and I am ready to be a coding master.</p>
